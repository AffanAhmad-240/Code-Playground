**Overview**
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Java.
It is a console-based two-player game where players take turns to place their marks (X and O) on a 3×3 board.
The game continues until one player wins or the board is full.

🎮 **Features**
Two-player mode (Player X vs Player O)
Input validation (prevents overwriting an already occupied cell)
Automatic detection of winning conditions (rows, columns, and diagonals)
Displays the game board after each move

⚙️ **How It Works**
The program initializes a 3x3 board filled with empty spaces.
Player X starts first, followed by Player O.
Players enter the row and column index (0 2) where they want to place their mark.
The game checks:
If the move is valid (empty cell).
If the player has won after the move.
The game ends when:
A player wins, or
The board is completely filled.

🚀 **How to Run**
Copy the code into a file named TicTacToe.java.
Open terminal/command prompt and compile:
javac TicTacToe.java

🔮 **Future Improvements**
Create a single-player mode with an AI opponent.
Build a GUI version using JavaFX or Swing.

A player wins, or

The board is completely filled.
